# Portfolio

Hi, this is just my portfolio website repo which I'm trying to rewrite in react with better coding practices..

TO DO:

-   [ ] use sass instead of css
-   [ ] Use Typescript instead of javascript (transpile to es5 but better if it uses es6 syntax)
-   [ ] adding code formatter, linters, prettify for pre commits (just following some software engineering norms)
-   [ ] Re-writing the whole code base in react-js
-   [ ] Use templates
-   [ ] create json file to store data (or protobuff -> Reminder: ditch the idea if the implementation is overly complicated )
-   [ ] Make the webstie responsive for both mobile(dont want to but ...) and web
-   [ ] Structure the file
-   [ ] Add a docker (not necessary), but hey its in mainstream!! people run
-   [ ] Fix the responsiveness on the icons added to the side bar

hello world code in docker nowadays..

Add when something new stuffs pop in mind ...
